# portfolio-page

This is my first indepedent/off the cuff project. Since I wasn't provided with any objectives, I realised I had to produce my own specification. I found it more difficult than any of the code I have produced thus far.

The index page is structured as series of slides, with each slide taking up 100% of the viewport height. This allows for a cleaner look when hero buttons scroll to their respective sections. The layout of each box is organised with flexbox, usually with both `justify-content` and `align-items` set to center. I alternated between gradients and solid colours for each slide, allowing the contrast to delineate between them. The contact bar was originally it's own slide, but it would only have a maximum of 5 links, and so it's size was reduced.

I am a huge fan of atomic css, and I found that it made both constructing and debugging this project a dream. Later on, especially with respect to the buttons, I seem to have slipped up and stuffed their classes full of properties. I also found the use of pseudoclasses both more intuitive, and elegant, than javascript.

The random fact button was a workaround to the customary difficulty one has in describing themselves.
